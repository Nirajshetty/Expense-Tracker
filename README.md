# Expense-Tracker
It is a multi-user web application with its unique savings plan.It provides secure authentication and has been built using PHP and MySQL.
The web app provides the user to enter the monthly salary and then enter the target saving amount he or she wants to save at the end of each month 
thus ensuring a way to keep their Savings plan on track.  Users can then enter the daily expenses that he or she has spent on that particular date.
The expense list can be updated any number of times. To check the progress the user clicks on progress option and voila.. there's your progress on your savings plan.
The expenses will be tracked on a monthly basis.The start date in the progress page represents the day when the user starts his expense tracking for that month.
Once the user reaches the end of the month or if the target savings is not met within that month, he or she can reset the expense list and then the user can again 
start tracking his or her expenses for the next month.
